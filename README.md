# UAV - the concourse pipeline generator

UAV can be used to generate and merge pipelines.  The original version is in the c++ directory and is the basis for the second golang version.

The golang version adds templating and a new `merge` directive to a concourse pipeline.

It's currently being dogfooded by us, and so far, it's useful.  Hopefully it can be useful for you too.

All the best.
The Finbourne Team.
